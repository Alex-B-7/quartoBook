    "text": "5.2 New RStudio Project via git clone\n\nI present two ways to do this:\n\nusethis::create_from_github()\nVia the RStudio IDE\n\nWhen you are cloning your own GitHub repository, the two methods are equivalent. In other scenarios, especially fork-and-clone, I think usethis::create_from_github() is superior, because it does additional, recommended setup.\nPick one of these methods below.\nusethis::create_from_github()\nusethis::create_from_github(\n  \"https://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO.git\",\n  destdir = \"~/path/to/where/you/want/the/local/repo/\"\n)\nYou can execute this command in any R session. If you use RStudio, then do this in the R console of any RStudio instance.\nThe first argument is repo_spec and it accepts the GitHub repo specification in various forms. In particular, you can use the URL we just copied from GitHub.\nThe destdir argument specifies the parent directory where you want the new folder (and local Git repo) to live. If you don’t specify destdir, usethis defaults to some very conspicuous place, like your desktop. If you like to keep Git repos in a certain folder on your computer, you can personalize this default by setting the usethis.destdir option in your .Rprofile.\nWe’re accepting the default behaviour of two other arguments, rstudio and open, because that’s what most people will want. For example, for an RStudio user, create_from_github() does this:\n\nCreates a new local directory in destdir, which is all of these things:\n\na directory or folder on your computer\na Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository\nan RStudio Project\n\nOpens a new RStudio instance in the new Project\nIn the absence of other constraints, I suggest that all of your R projects have exactly this set-up.\n\n\n5.2.1 RStudio IDE\nIn RStudio, start a new Project:\n\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like thishttps://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git.\nBe intentional about where you create this Project.\nI suggest you “Open in new session”.\nClick “Create Project” to create a new directory, which will be all of these things:\n\na directory or “folder” on your computer\na Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository\nan RStudio Project\n\nIn the absence of other constraints, I suggest that all of your R projects have exactly this set-up.\n\nThis should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file.\nBehind the scenes, RStudio has done this for you:\ngit clone https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git\n\n\n5.2.2 Have a look around\nRegardless of whether you used usethis or RStudio, you should now be working in the new Git repo. The implicit git clone should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file.\nThere’s a big advantage to the “GitHub first, then RStudio” workflow: the remote GitHub repo is configured as the origin remote for your local repo and your local main branch is now tracking the main on GitHub. This is a technical but important point about Git. The practical implication is that you are now set up to push and pull. No need to fanny around setting up Git remotes and tracking branches on the command line.\nWe’re about to confirm we are setup for pulling and pushing.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Optional: peek under the hood\nCompletely optional activity: use command line Git to see what we’re talking about above, i.e. the remote and tracking branch setup.\ngit remote -v or git remote --verbose shows the remotes you have setup. Here’s how that looks for someone using HTTPS with GitHub and calling it origin:\n~/tmp/myrepo % git remote -v\norigin  https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git (push)\ngit branch -vv prints info about the current branch (-vv for “very verbose”, I guess). In particular, we can see that local main is tracking the main branch on origin, a.k.a. origin/main.\n~/tmp/myrepo % git branch -vv\n* main 2899c91 [origin/main] A commit from my local computer\nFinally, git remote show origin gives yet another view on useful remote and branch information:\n~/tmp/myrepo % git remote show origin    \n* remote origin\n  Fetch URL: https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git\n  Push  URL: https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git\n  HEAD branch: main\n  Remote branch:\n    main tracked\n  Local branch configured for 'git pull':\n    main merges with remote main\n  Local ref configured for 'git push':\n    main pushes to main (up to date)\ngit clone, which RStudio did for us, sets all of this up automatically. This is why “GitHub first, then RStudio” is the preferred way to start projects early in your Git/GitHub life.",

    "section": "3.2 HTTPS versus SSH",
    "text": "3.2 HTTPS versus SSH\nI find HTTPS easier to get working quickly and strongly recommend it when you first start working with Git/GitHub. HTTPS is what GitHub recommends, presumably for exactly the same reasons. The “ease of use” argument in favor of HTTPS is especially true for Windows users. I started with HTTPS, preferred SSH for a while, and have returned to HTTPS. The main thing to know is that this is not an all-or-nothing decision and it’s a relatively easy decision to revisit later.\nAnother advantage of HTTPS is that the PAT we’ll set up for that can also be used with GitHub’s REST API. That might not mean anything to you (yet), but there are many R packages that call GitHub’s API on your behalf (devtools+usethis, remotes, pak, gh, etc.). Configuring your PAT kills two birds with one stone: this single credential can be used to authenticate to GitHub as a regular Git server and for its REST API. If you authenticate via SSH for “regular” Git work, you will still have to set up a PAT for work that uses the REST API.\n\nA properly configured PAT means all of this will “just work”:\n\nRemote HTTPS operations via command line Git and, therefore, via RStudio\nRemote HTTPS operations via the gert R package and, therefore, usethis\nGitHub API operations via the gh R package and, therefore, usethis\n\n\n3.2.1 URL determines the protocol\nEven though I’m suggesting that you adopt HTTPS as a lifestyle, it’s good to know that you actually have very granular control over the protocol. It is determined by the URL used to access a remote repo. Feel free to skip this section if you are new to Git (we mention some concepts and commands that won’t make much sense ’til you’ve used Git a little).\nHTTPS remote URLs look like https://github.com/&lt;OWNER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git.\nSSH remote URLs look like git@github.com:&lt;OWNER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git.\n\nWhen you execute a command such as git push origin my-cool-feature-branch, Git looks up the URL you’ve stored for the origin remote and uses the protocol implicit in the URL’s format. The protocol is a game time decision.\nThis implies that:\n\nIt’s fine to use HTTPS for one remote in a repo and SSH for another.\nIt’s fine to use HTTPS in one repo and SSH in another.\nIt’s fine to interact with a GitHub repo via HTTPS from one computer and via SSH from another.\nIt’s fine to adopt HTTPS for new work, even if some of your pre-existing repos use SSH.\n\nYou just have to be aware that mixed use of HTTPS and SSH means you’ll have to configure both sorts of credentials.\nChanging a specific remote from HTTPS to SSH (and back again) is a straightforward operation with git remote set-url REMOTE_NAME DESIRED_URL:\n~/rrr/happy-git-with-r % git remote -v\norigin  https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git (push)\n\n~/rrr/happy-git-with-r % git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git\n\n~/rrr/happy-git-with-r % git remote -v\norigin  git@github.com:jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git (push)\n\n~/rrr/happy-git-with-r % git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git\nWe can do the same from R using functions in usethis:\nusethis::git_remotes()\n#&gt; $origin\n#&gt; [1] \"https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git\"\n\nusethis::use_git_remote(\n  \"origin\",\n  \"git@github.com:jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git\",\n  overwrite = TRUE\n)\n\nusethis::git_remotes()\n#&gt; $origin\n#&gt; [1] \"git@github.com:jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git\"\n\nusethis::use_git_remote(\n  \"origin\",\n  \"https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git\",\n  overwrite = TRUE\n)",

You could click on “Generate new token” here or, perhaps even better, you could call usethis::create_github_token() from R:\nusethis::create_github_token()\nThe usethis approach takes you to a pre-filled form where we have pre-selected some recommended scopes, which you can look over and adjust before clicking “Generate token”. At the time of writing, the usethis-recommended scopes are “repo”, “user”, “gist”, and “workflow”.\n\nIt is a very good idea to describe the token’s purpose in the Note field, because one day you might have multiple PATs. We recommend naming each token after its use case, such as the computer or project you are using it for, e.g. “personal-macbook-air” or “vm-for-project-xyz”. In the future, you will find yourself staring at this list of tokens, because inevitably you’ll need to re-generate or delete one of them. Make it easy to figure out which token you’ve come here to fiddle with.\nGitHub encourages the use of perishable tokens, with a default Expiration period of 30 days. Unless you have a specific reason to fight this, I recommend accepting this default. I assume that GitHub’s security folks have good reasons for their recommendation. But, of course, you can adjust the Expiration behaviour as you see fit, including “No expiration”.\nOnce you’re happy with the token’s Note, Expiration, and Scopes, click “Generate token”.\nYou won’t be able to see this token again, so don’t close or navigate away from this browser window until you store the PAT locally. Copy the PAT to the clipboard, anticipating what we’ll do next: trigger a prompt that lets us store the PAT in the Git credential store.\nTreat this PAT like a password! Do not ever hard-wire your PAT into your code! A PAT should always be retrieved implicitly, for example, from the Git credential store. We’re about to help you store the PAT in a safe place, where command line Git, RStudio, and R packages can discover it.\nIf you use a password management app, such as 1Password or LastPass (highly recommended!), you might want to also add this PAT (and its Note) to the entry for GitHub, where you’re already storing your username and password. Storing your PAT in the Git credential store is a semi-persistent convenience, sort of like a browser cache or “remember me” on a website3 and it’s conceivable you will need to re-enter your PAT in the future. You could decide to embrace the impermanence of your PAT and, if it somehow goes missing, you’ll just re-generate the PAT and re-store it. If you accept the default 30-day expiration period, this is a workflow you’ll be using often anyway. But if you create long-lasting tokens or want to feel free to play around with the functions for setting or clearing your Git credentials, it can be handy to have your own record of your PAT in a secure place, like 1Password or LastPass.",

    "text": "3.5 HTTPS PAT problems and solutions\nThis section is for people who need to know even more about PAT management, because they’re in a nonstandard situation or troubleshooting.\n\n3.5.1 Valid PAT gets stored, but later told the PAT is invalid\nLet’s say you generate a fresh PAT and successfully store it as described above. Maybe you even use it successfully. But later, you’re told your PAT is invalid! How can this be?\nHere are some likely explanations:\n\nYour PAT truly is invalid. By default, PATs have an expiration date now. One day you really will wake up and find the PAT has gone bad overnight and you need to re-generate and re-store it.\nYou have an invalid PAT stored somewhere else, that you’ve forgotten about, probably in .Renviron. This old, invalid PAT is preventing R packages from even discovering your new, valid PAT.\n\n\n3.5.1.1 PAT has expired\nYou are going to be re-generating and re-storing your PAT on a schedule dictated by its expiration period. By default, once per month.\nWhen the PAT expires, return to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click on its Note. (You do label your tokens nicely by use case, right? Right?) At this point, you can optionally adjust scopes and then click “Regenerate token”. You can optionally modify its Expiration and then click “Regenerate token” (again). As before, copy the PAT to the clipboard, call gitcreds::gitcreds_set(), and paste!\nHopefully it’s becoming clear why each token’s Note is so important. The actual token may be changing, e.g., once a month, but its use case (and scopes) are much more persistent and stable.\n\n\n3.5.1.2 Old GITHUB_PAT in .Renviron\nThese usethis functions will diagnose this problem:\nusethis::gh_token_help()\n\nusethis::git_sitrep()\nIn the past, it was common to store a PAT as the GITHUB_PAT environment variable in .Renviron. But now, thanks to gitcreds and credentials, we can store and retrieve a PAT, from R, the same way as command line Git does.\nIf you have any doubt about your previous practices, open .Renviron, look for a line setting the GITHUB_PAT environment variable, and delete it. usethis::edit_r_environ() can be helpful for getting .Renviron open for editing. Don’t forget to restart R for this change to take effect.\n\n\n\n3.5.2 PAT doesn’t persist on macOS or Windows\nThe credential helpers used by Git take advantage of official OS-provided credential stores, where possible, such as macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager.\nIf you’re trying to follow the advice here and your PAT never persists, consider that you may need to update Git to get its more modern credential helpers. This is absolutely an area of Git that has improved rapidly in recent years and the gitcreds and credentials package work best with recent versions of Git. I have not needed to explicitly activate a credential helper on macOS or Windows with any recent version of Git.\nHere’s a command to reveal the current credential helper and what I see these days.\nmacOS\n$ git config --show-origin --get credential.helper\nfile:/Users/jenny/.gitconfig    osxkeychain\nWindows\n$ git config --show-origin --get credential.helper\nfile:C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/etc/gitconfig manager\nIf you want to know how more about how gitcreds and credentials are managing your PAT, learn about git credential &lt;fill|approve|reject&gt;. For keeners, that documentation gives you the gory details on how credentials are stored and retrieved:\n\nGit has an internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for usernames and passwords. The git-credential command exposes this interface to scripts which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in the same manner as Git.\n\nOn Windows, your Git credentials are probably being stored via Credential Manager.\nOn macOS, your Git credentials are probably being stored in the Keychain.\nIf you really want to poke around directly to explore or clean out your GitHub credentials, launch Credential Manager (Windows) or Keychain Access (macOS) and search for “github.com”.",
